Within my current role, I build internal tooling using Python and Typescript, with the tooling hosted on AWS.

I make use of Serverless functions to automate toil, while also leading the development of an application with a Flask backend (hosted on ECS) and a React frontend (hosted as a Jamstack deployment using a combination of Cloudfront & S3.)

I write CI/CD Pipelines in GitHub Actions & Jenkins (preferably on Actions), with all source code being held on GitHub.

I work with the following AWS technologies: ECS, EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, Cloudfront, and VPC.

I'm a DevOps Engineer based in Manchester.

My primary responsibilties involve building and maintaining my company's Developer Productivity suite, using a mixture of vendor products and custom-built internal tools.

Outside of work, I'm a fitness enthusiast, a cryptocurrency evangelist/investor, a gamer, and I love getting to concerts (primarily heavy metal).

I've built this site  as a static site, compiled using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with the [hugo tanka theme](https://github.com/nanxstats/hugo-tanka).

The site is deployed using a [GitHub Actions Pipeline](https://github.com/angusjellis/personal-site/blob/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yaml).

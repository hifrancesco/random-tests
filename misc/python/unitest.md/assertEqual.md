This is a collection of unit tests for a set of functions that perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus). The tests are implemented using the unittest module in Python.

Each operation is tested in its own class, which subclasses unittest.TestCase. Each class contains one test method that checks the result of the operation and asserts that it's equal to the expected value.

For example, the TestAddition class tests the add function. The test_addition method calls add with the arguments 3 and 4, and then asserts that the result is equal to 7 using the assertEqual method.

If all tests pass, the program will output nothing. If any of the tests fail, an error message will be displayed indicating which test failed and what the expected and actual values were.

When the script is run using if __name__ == '__main__':, the unittest.main() method is called, which automatically discovers and runs all the test classes and methods in the script.

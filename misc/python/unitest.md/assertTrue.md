In this example, we have a function is_positive that takes a number and returns True if it's positive, and False otherwise. The TestIsPositive class contains two test methods, test_positive_number and test_negative_number, that test the is_positive function with positive and negative numbers, respectively.

The test_positive_number method checks that the result of calling is_positive with the argument 5 is True, using the assertTrue method. If the result is True, the test will pass and nothing will be output. If the result is False, the test will fail and the optional error message "5 is a positive number" will be displayed.

Similarly, the test_negative_number method checks that the result of calling is_positive with the argument -5 is False, using the assertFalse method. If the result is False, the test will pass and nothing will be output. If the result is True, the test will fail and the optional error message "-5 is not a positive number" will be displayed.

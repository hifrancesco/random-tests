In this example, we have a function calculate_pi that returns an approximation of the mathematical constant pi.

The TestCalculatePi class contains one test method, test_calculate_pi, that tests the calculate_pi function. This test uses the assertAlmostEqual method to check that the result of calculate_pi is equal to 3.14 with a precision of two decimal places.

If the result of calculate_pi is equal to 3.14 with a precision of two decimal places, the test will pass and nothing will be output. If the result is not equal, the test will fail and an error message will be displayed indicating what the expected and actual values were.

unittest.TestCase is a class in the Python standard library's unittest module that provides a framework for writing and running tests. The TestCase class provides a number of methods for testing the behavior of your code. Here are some commonly used methods:

    assertEqual(a, b): checks that a and b are equal. Raises an AssertionError if they are not.
    assertTrue(x): checks that x is truthy. Raises an AssertionError if it's not.
    assertFalse(x): checks that x is falsy. Raises an AssertionError if it's not.
    assertRaises(exception, callable, *args, **kwds): checks that calling callable with the specified arguments raises the specified exception.
    assertAlmostEqual(a, b, places=7, msg=None, delta=None): checks that a and b are approximately equal, within a certain number of decimal places.

These are just a few examples of the methods available in unittest.TestCase. You can find more information and a complete list of methods in the Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase

- PEOPLE, PLACE, PURPOSE, PLOT


1. Linear narrative is a storytelling technique in which events are presented in a chronological and sequential manner, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The plot unfolds in a straightforward and logical way, and the story is presented in a linear progression from start to finish. Linear narrative is often used in traditional storytelling forms such as novels, films, and plays. It is opposed to non-linear narrative, in which events are presented out of chronological order or in a more complex and fragmented way.

2. Non-linear narrative is a storytelling technique in which events are presented out of chronological order or in a fragmented way. This can include using flashbacks, flash-forwards, multiple perspectives, or other devices that disrupt the linear progression of the story. Instead of a clear beginning, middle, and end, the plot is often more complex and may involve multiple threads or storylines that eventually come together. Non-linear narrative is used in various forms of media such as literature, film, and video games. It allows for more creative freedom and can engage audiences by challenging their perception of time and causality.

3. A quest narrative is a type of storytelling that centers around a character or group of characters going on a journey or mission to achieve a specific goal. This journey often involves overcoming obstacles, gaining allies, and acquiring knowledge or skills along the way. The goal of the quest may be something tangible, such as an object or location, or it may be more abstract, such as self-discovery or the attainment of a certain state of being. Quest narratives are a common trope in literature, film, and video games, and can be a powerful way to explore themes of adventure, growth, and overcoming challenges.

4. In literature and film, a viewpoint narrative refers to the perspective from which a story is told. The viewpoint can be that of a specific character, known as a first-person viewpoint, or it can be that of an omniscient narrator, known as a third-person viewpoint.
A first-person viewpoint allows the audience to see the story through the eyes of a particular character, and can create a sense of intimacy and immediacy. The audience can only know what the character knows and only sees what the character sees.
A third-person viewpoint allows the audience to see the story from an outside perspective and can provide a more objective view of the events. The narrator can describe the thoughts, feelings and internal states of any of the characters.
There is also a second-person viewpoint, where the audience is addressed directly in the narrative and made to feel as if they are a character within the story. This is less common and not as extensively used in literature, film and video games, but it is used in interactive fiction and other interactive forms of storytelling.
The choice of viewpoint can have a significant impact on how the story is perceived and can shape the audience's understanding of the characters and events.

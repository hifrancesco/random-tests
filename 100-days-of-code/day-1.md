Variables are reserved memory locations to store values in order to store some type of value.

Data type is an important concept. Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.



# def greet(name):
#     if name is not None:
#         print("This is " + name + "!")
#     else:
#         print("Follow me for awesome content.")
        
# greet("CloudFrancesco")
# greet(None)

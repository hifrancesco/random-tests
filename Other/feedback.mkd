## Unit Tests

To add unit tests to your Python Lambda function, you can follow these steps:

- Create a test file: Create a separate file with the naming convention test_<your_lambda_function_name>.py (e.g. test_lambda_function.py). In this file, import the modules and libraries used by your Lambda function and define the unit tests for each function in your code.

- Install test dependencies: Install the necessary testing dependencies, such as pytest, by adding them to your requirements.txt file or using pip to install them locally in your project directory.

- Write test cases: Write test cases for your Lambda function using a test framework, such as pytest. For example, you can write tests that simulate different input parameters, test edge cases, and verify the output of the function.

- Import and invoke the function: In your test file, import the Lambda function and invoke it with the test data. You can use the boto3 library to create an event object that simulates an event trigger for your Lambda function.

- Run the tests: Run the unit tests by using the test runner provided by the test framework. For example, to run tests using pytest, you can run the command pytest in your project directory.

- Verify the results: Verify that your tests pass and that your Lambda function behaves as expected. You can also use code coverage tools, such as pytest-cov, to measure the code coverage of your tests.


## EventBridge

You can create a rule in Amazon EventBridge to invoke your AWS Lambda function every 12 hours by following these steps:

- Create a Lambda function: If you haven't already, create a Lambda function that you want to be invoked by EventBridge. You can create a function using the AWS Lambda Console or by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).

- Create a rule in EventBridge: In the AWS EventBridge console, create a rule that specifies the event pattern that you want to trigger your Lambda function. In this case, you'll want to use a scheduled event to trigger the Lambda function every 12 hours.

- Configure the scheduled expression: In the rule configuration, set the schedule expression to a cron expression that specifies the time interval you want to trigger the Lambda function. For example, to trigger the Lambda function every 12 hours, you can use the following cron expression: "0 0 */12 ? * * *".

- Add the Lambda function as a target for the rule: In the same rule configuration page, add the Lambda function as a target for the rule. You can do this by selecting the "Add target" button and selecting "Lambda function" as the target type. Then, select the Lambda function you want to invoke from the dropdown list.

- Configure the IAM role: Make sure that the IAM role associated with your Lambda function has the necessary permissions to receive events from EventBridge. You can add the "AmazonEventBridgeFullAccess" policy to the role to grant the necessary permissions.

- Test the integration: Once you have configured EventBridge to trigger your Lambda function, you can test the integration by waiting for the scheduled time or by manually triggering the rule using the "Test" feature in the EventBridge console.

After you have completed these steps, EventBridge will start triggering your Lambda function every 12 hours according to the cron expression you specified in the rule configuration.

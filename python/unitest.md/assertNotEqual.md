In this example, we have a function compare_numbers that compares two numbers and returns True if they are not equal and False otherwise.

The TestCompareNumbers class contains one test method, test_compare_numbers, that tests the compare_numbers function. This test uses the assertNotEqual method to check that the result of compare_numbers(10, 20) is not equal to False.

If the result of compare_numbers(10, 20) is not equal to False, the test will pass and nothing will be output. If the result is equal to False, the test will fail and an error message will be displayed indicating what the expected and actual values were.

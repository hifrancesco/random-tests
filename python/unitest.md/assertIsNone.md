In this example, we have a function return_none that returns None.

The TestReturnNone class contains one test method, test_return_none, that tests the return_none function. This test uses the assertIsNone method to check that the result of return_none() is None.

If the result of return_none() is None, the test will pass and nothing will be output. If the result is not None, the test will fail and an error message will be displayed indicating what the expected and actual values were.

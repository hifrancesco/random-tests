In this example, we have a function divide that takes two numbers and returns their division. If the second number is zero, a ValueError is raised with the message "division by zero".

The TestDivide class contains one test method, test_division_by_zero, that tests the divide function with the arguments 5 and 0. This test uses the assertRaises method to check that a ValueError is raised when divide is called with these arguments. The assertRaises method is used in a with statement, so that the context of the raised exception can be captured and inspected.

In this case, the assertEqual method is used to check that the string representation of the raised exception is equal to the expected message "division by zero". If the ValueError is raised with the correct message, the test will pass and nothing will be output. If the ValueError is not raised, or if it's raised with a different message, the test will fail and an error message will be displayed.

SARIF stands for Static Analysis Results Interchange Format. It is an open standard developed by the OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) consortium. SARIF defines a standardized output file format that allows static analysis tools to share and exchange their analysis results.

Static analysis tools are used in software development to analyze source code or compiled binaries and identify potential issues, bugs, or security vulnerabilities. SARIF provides a common format for these tools to report their findings, making it easier to consume and process the results in a consistent manner.


By using SARIF, developers can integrate multiple static analysis tools into their development workflows and have a unified view of the results. SARIF files can be ingested by various tools and platforms, allowing developers to analyze and track code quality, security vulnerabilities, and other issues across different environments.
SARIF supports a rich set of information, including details about the analysis tool, rules used, specific results, and related metadata. It allows for the inclusion of location information within the source code, making it easier to navigate to the problematic areas and understand the reported issues.


GitHub, a popular software development platform, has also adopted SARIF for its code scanning feature. It allows developers to upload SARIF files generated by their static analysis tools and view the results directly within their GitHub repositories.
Overall, SARIF improves interoperability and facilitates the exchange of static analysis results between different tools and platforms, enhancing the overall software development and code quality assurance process.

•	SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) is used to share results from static analysis tools.
•	Code scanning on GitHub supports a subset of the SARIF 2.1.0 JSON schema.
•	Uploading SARIF files allows displaying code scanning alerts in your GitHub repository.
•	SARIF files should be in the SARIF 2.1.0 version and can be uploaded from third-party static code analysis engines.
•	Multiple SARIF files can be uploaded for the same commit, and each file can have a specified category.
•	Results from different runs are matched using fingerprints to prevent duplicate alerts.
•	Consistent filepaths are necessary for proper fingerprint computation and to avoid duplicate alerts.
•	Fingerprint data can be included in SARIF files, or GitHub attempts to populate it from source files.
•	SARIF files contain rules and results, where rules define the analysis rules and results contain details of alerts.
•	The root for source files can be specified to convert absolute URIs to relative URIs.
•	SARIF files can be validated for compatibility using the Microsoft SARIF validator.
•	There are limits on the size and number of entries for SARIF files in code scanning.
•	Certain SARIF properties are supported by code scanning for optimal display of analysis results on GitHub.

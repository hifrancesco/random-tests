When applications communicate with external systems, you need to authenticate to gain access. This is performed through *secrets*. 

Secret scanning: you can configure to notify certain users if a secret has been found. The users may also choose to ignore the alert if it is a false positive.

Secret scanning in GitHub Advanced Security is a crucial feature that helps prevent the accidental exposure of sensitive information, such as API keys, access tokens, and other credentials, within your codebase. It scans your code and repositories to detect and alert you about any exposed secrets, allowing you to take immediate action to secure them.


Secret scanning in GitHub Advanced Security:

    Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information
    Scans your code and repositories
    Detects exposed secrets (API keys, tokens, credentials)
    Notifies you to take necessary security measures

With secret scanning, you can proactively identify and address security risks by ensuring that sensitive information is not inadvertently exposed in your code. By detecting exposed secrets early on, you can avoid potential security breaches or unauthorized access to your systems.

By leveraging this feature, you can maintain the confidentiality of your credentials and protect your applications and services from potential vulnerabilities associated with secret exposure.

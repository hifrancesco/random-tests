Static analysis is a technique used in software development and testing to examine code without executing it. It involves analyzing the source code or compiled code of a software application to identify potential defects, bugs, security vulnerabilities, coding errors, or other issues.

Here's a simplified explanation of static analysis:

Static analysis:

    Examines code without running it
    Identifies defects, bugs, vulnerabilities, errors
    Analyzes source code or compiled code
    Helps improve code quality and security

Static analysis tools analyze the code by examining its syntax, structure, and dependencies to detect potential issues. These tools can check for a wide range of problems, such as memory leaks, uninitialized variables, dead code, coding conventions violations, potential security vulnerabilities, and more.

Static analysis is especially useful for detecting issues that might be difficult to find through manual code review or testing. It provides developers with insights into code quality and security, helping them identify and fix potential problems early in the development process.

By incorporating static analysis into the development workflow, developers can enhance code quality, improve software reliability, and mitigate security risks.

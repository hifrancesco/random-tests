Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world around them, in much the same way as humans do. It involves the development of algorithms and techniques that allow machines to analyze and process digital images or videos, and extract meaningful insights from them.

The ultimate goal of computer vision is to create machines that can see and interpret the visual world in the same way that humans do, and to use this information to make intelligent decisions or perform useful tasks. This requires a deep understanding of how the human visual system works, as well as expertise in machine learning, computer graphics, and image processing.

Computer vision has many practical applications, such as:

- Object recognition: Identifying and classifying objects within an image or video, such as people, cars, or buildings.

- Image segmentation: Separating an image into distinct regions or segments based on its visual characteristics, such as color, texture, or brightness.

- Face recognition: Identifying individuals based on their facial features, such as for security or identification purposes.

- Medical imaging: Analyzing medical images to aid in diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

- Autonomous vehicles: Enabling vehicles to "see" and navigate their environment, avoiding obstacles and making intelligent decisions.

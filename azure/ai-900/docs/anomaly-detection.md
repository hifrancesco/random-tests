Anomaly detection is a technique used in data analysis to identify data points or events that deviate significantly from the expected or normal behavior of a system. Anomalies, also known as outliers, may represent unusual, unexpected, or rare events that may require further investigation or action. Anomaly detection algorithms can be applied in various domains, such as fraud detection, intrusion detection, fault detection, and system health monitoring, among others. There are different approaches to anomaly detection, including statistical methods, machine learning, and deep learning techniques.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that are widely used in computer vision applications. They are particularly well-suited for image recognition tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

The basic building block of a CNN is a convolutional layer, which applies a series of filters or kernels to an input image. Each filter is a small matrix of weights that is convolved (i.e., slid) across the image, computing a dot product between the filter and each overlapping patch of pixels. This process results in a feature map, which captures the presence of specific visual patterns or features in the image, such as edges, corners, and textures.

Multiple convolutional layers are typically stacked on top of each other, allowing the network to learn increasingly complex and abstract representations of the image. Between the convolutional layers, there may be other types of layers such as pooling layers, which reduce the spatial dimensionality of the feature maps, and fully connected layers, which perform the final classification based on the learned features.

CNNs are trained using a large dataset of labeled images and a loss function that measures the error between the predicted and true labels. During training, the weights of the filters are adjusted through backpropagation to minimize the loss and improve the accuracy of the network.

Overall, CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision and are now the state-of-the-art method for many image recognition tasks. They have been used to achieve remarkable results on a wide range of challenging datasets, and continue to be an active area of research in the field.

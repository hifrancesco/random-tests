Text extraction in computer vision refers to the process of automatically identifying and extracting textual information from images or video frames. The goal of text extraction is to convert the visual representation of text into a machine-readable format, such as a digital text document or a database.

Text extraction involves several steps, including:

- Text detection: The first step in text extraction is to identify the regions of an image or video frame that contain text. This can be done using techniques such as edge detection, color segmentation, or machine learning-based object detection algorithms.

- Text recognition: Once the text regions have been identified, the next step is to recognize the actual characters or words in the image. This can be done using optical character recognition (OCR) techniques, which convert the visual representation of text into machine-readable characters.

- Text normalization: In order to improve the accuracy of the text recognition process, text normalization techniques may be applied to standardize the appearance of the text. This can include tasks such as removing noise or artifacts, adjusting the font size or orientation, and correcting for perspective distortion.

- Post-processing: Finally, the extracted text may undergo further post-processing steps to clean and refine the output. This can include tasks such as spell checking, language identification, or entity recognition.

Text extraction has many applications in fields such as document analysis, information retrieval, and automated text translation. By automatically extracting text from images and video frames, it enables more efficient processing and analysis of visual information, and can help to bridge the gap between visual and textual data.

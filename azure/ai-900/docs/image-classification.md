Image classification in computer vision refers to the process of categorizing images into one or more predefined classes or categories. The goal of image classification is to automatically identify and label images based on their visual features or characteristics, such as color, texture, and shape.

Image classification is typically performed using machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are trained on a dataset of labeled images. During the training process, the algorithm learns to recognize patterns and features in the images that are associated with specific categories. Once the training is complete, the algorithm can then be used to classify new, unlabeled images.

For example, an image classification algorithm may be trained on a dataset of cat and dog images. During the training process, the algorithm learns to recognize the visual features that are unique to each animal, such as the shape of their ears and the color of their fur. Once the training is complete, the algorithm can be used to classify new images of cats and dogs, accurately identifying which animal is present in the image.

Image classification has many practical applications, such as object recognition, content-based image retrieval, and automated image tagging. It is a fundamental task in computer vision and forms the basis for many other computer vision applications.

# [Create a clustering model with Azure Machine Learning designer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/create-clustering-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/)

## [Introduction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/create-clustering-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/1-introduction)

You can use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning designer to create clustering models by using a drag and drop visual interface, without needing to write any code.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Identify common clustering machine learning scenarios.
- Use Azure Machine Learning designer to train a clustering model.
- Use a clustering model for inferencing.
- Deploy a clustering model as a service.

## [Identify clustering machine learning scenarios](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/create-clustering-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/2-clustering-scenarios)

*Clustering* is a form of machine learning that is used to group similar items into clusters based on their features. For example, a researcher might take measurements of penguins, and group them based on similarities in their proportions.

Clustering is an example of unsupervised machine learning, in which you train a model to separate items into clusters based purely on their characteristics, or features. There is no previously known cluster value (or label) from which to train the model.

### Scenarios for clustering machine learning models

Clustering machine learning models are used in many industries. A few scenarios are:

- Cluster customer attribute data into segments for marketing analysis.
- Cluster geographic coordinates into regions of high traffic in a city for a ride-share application.
- Cluster written feedback into topics to prioritize customer service changes.

In GitHub Actions, the `workflow_run` event is triggered when a workflow is run, either manually or automatically. This event is triggered when a workflow is executed, and it allows you to take actions based on the outcome of the workflow run.

The `workflow_run` event is emitted as a webhook payload and it contains information about the workflow run, such as the workflow's name, the repository it's associated with, the state of the workflow run (e.g. whether it succeeded or failed), and the commit SHA that triggered the run.

You can use the `workflow_run` event to perform custom actions, like sending notifications, updating issue labels, or triggering another workflow. For example, you can use this event to notify your team when a workflow run fails and needs attention.

You can use the `workflow_run` event to create a listener that listens to this event and performs actions based on the event payload. You can create a listener using a GitHub Action or a webhook receiver that you host on your own infrastructure.

It's important to note that you can also filter the `workflow_run` event by the status of the run (e.g. success, failure, and neutral) to only trigger specific actions based on the outcome.

```yml
name: Workflow Run Notifier

on:
  workflow_run:
    types: [failed]

jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Send Slack notification
      uses: slack/actions/slack-message@v2
      env:
        SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
      with:
        message: "Workflow run failed on repository: ${{ github.repository }} Commit: ${{ github.sha }}"
```

This template listens to the workflow_run event that has a status of "failed" and triggers a job named "notify" that sends a message to a slack channel.

It uses the slack-message action from the marketplace that allows you to send a message to a Slack channel, and it also uses environment variables to pass the SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL which is stored as a secret in the repository.

You can customize the message or the notification channel to match your needs. You can also add more steps to this job such as sending an email notification or updating an issue with the failed run details.

You can also use this template as a starting point and refer to the official GitHub Actions documentation to learn more about the different options and configurations available for building and customizing your workflows.
